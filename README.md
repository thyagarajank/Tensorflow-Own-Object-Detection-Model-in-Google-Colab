# tensorflow-1.15-GPU-own-customized-object-detection-model-in-google-colab
In this project, we will use Google Colab for model training and run the Tensorflow own customized object detection model. Colab is a free Jupyter Notebook environment hosted by Google that runs on the cloud. Google Colab provides free access to GPUs (Graphical Processing Units) and TPUs (Tensor Processing Units).
